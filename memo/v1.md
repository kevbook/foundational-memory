# Fabric Labs

Fabric is building the connective tissue for personal AI. A foundational system that weaves scattered signals into coherent, living context and enables task-executing AI models for everyday life.

## Introduction

When ChatGPT launched in 2022, it fundamentally changed how people think and work. Adoption spread at unprecedented speed as people began using AI as a thought partner; to rewrite emails, brainstorm ideas, plan decisions, and reason through problems. 

A recent OpenAI study shows that nearly 70% of usage is personal rather than work related, revealing an important pattern; AI's first breakout was not as a productivity tool, but as a personal cognitive companion.

The next wave shifted from conversation to execution. General purpose AI agents and platforms emerged to execute real workflows, not just generate text. Products like **Manus** and agentic browsers from **Perplexity** and **OpenAI** demonstrated that AI could autonomously navigate tools, make decisions, and complete multi-step tasks.

In parallel, verticalized AI platforms emerged across specific domains. Products like Cursor, Decagon, Harvey, Legora, and Ambience Healthcare embed generative AI directly into domain specific workflows. Rather than acting as standalone chat interfaces, these systems use models as an abstraction layer over workflow, context engineering (memory), and recursive problem solving. The result is AI that understands how work is actually done, maintaining context across tasks and operating continuously within complex processes. Adoption was driven by early adopters (developers) and organizations burdened by costly, repetitive workflows.

Despite AI's initial breakout being overwhelmingly personal, the products that followed were built almost entirely for work (early adopters and prosumers). This left a meaningful gap in the market; AI that understands how people actually live, not just how they work. Personal, everyday workflows were never fully productized.

This gap is structural, not accidental. The challenge is multi-layered. The first constraint is form factor. Most "normies" primarily operate on mobile devices, while AI tooling was designed for desktop environments. Desktop platforms offer integrations, native connectors, and permissive access to local context. This shaped both what was technically feasible and what product teams chose to prioritize.

As a result, the ecosystem has coalesced around desktop first context access. Protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the rise of MCP servers make it straightforward for agents to tap into local file systems, application state, and OS level services. On macOS, for example, bridge mechanisms enable access to files, notes, messages, and other system-level context, giving AI deep visibility into a user’s digital workspace. This architecture works well for professional workflows, where context is structured, permissioned, and relatively standardized.

This does not translate to personal workflows, where context is fragmented across mobile first surfaces such as social feeds, messaging apps, and video platforms, where operating-system access is constrained and APIs are limited or nonexistent.

Inspiration often comes from passive consumption; an IG or TikTok video. Intent is fluid and situational. A user shopping for work clothes is expressing a different identity, set of constraints, and priorities than the same user shopping for workout gear later that day. People do not have a single, consistent “persona”; they operate across multiple modes depending on vibe, time, role, and context.

Compounding this, personal workflows are highly non-standardized. Everyone has a bespoke system, often loosely held together with Apple Notes, screenshots, reminders, saved links, and half-finished to-do lists. There is no canonical schema for "life". The workflows themselves are open-ended and heterogeneous in nature, spanning areas such as:
- Personal administration (bills, forms, renewals)
- Health and wellness management
- Household and maintenance
- Scheduling and coordination
- Travel and logistics
- Finances and subscriptions
- Digital organization (email, files, photos)

Each of these domains differs in cadence, emotional weight, and structure, and they frequently intersect in unpredictable ways. Compared to professional workflows, this is a problem of an entirely different magnitude. Building a truly personal AI requires a system that can reason across fragmented signals, shifting identities, and non-deterministic goals, while maintaining long-term context and trust.

This creates the fundamental challenge facing personal AI: how do you build a system that understands the full context of a user’s life, when that context is deeply personal, deeply fragmented, and constantly evolving?

It's a magnitude larger and more complex problem.
