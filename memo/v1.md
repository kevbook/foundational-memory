# Fabric Labs

Fabric is building the connective tissue for personal AI. It is a foundational layer that weaves fragmented signals into a coherent, living context. This enables AI that can actually run your life - not just talk about it.

## Introduction

When ChatGPT launched in 2022, it fundamentally changed how people think. Adoption spread at unprecedented speed as AI became a personal thought partner, rewriting messages, brainstorming ideas, and reasoning through problems.

A recent OpenAI study reveals nearly 70% of usage is personal, not work-related. This shows an important pattern: AI’s first breakout was not as a productivity tool, but as a personal cognitive companion.

The next wave moved from conversation to execution. General-purpose AI platforms emerged to execute workflows, not just generate text. Products like **Manus** and agentic browsers from **Perplexity** and **OpenAI** demonstrated that AI could navigate tools, do deep research, make decisions, and complete multi-step tasks autonomously.

Verticalized AI platforms also emerged across specific domains. Products like **Cursor**, **Decagon**, **Harvey**, **Legora**, and **Ambience Healthcare** embed AI directly into domain-specific workflows. Rather than acting as standalone chat interfaces, these platforms use models as an abstraction layer over workflows, context management (memory), and recursive problem-solving. They offer AI that understands how work is actually done, maintains context across tasks, and operates within complex processes. Early adopters (developers) and organizations with repetitive workflows drove adoption.

## The Gap

Although AI’s initial breakout was personal, nearly all subsequent products have been built for work, serving early adopters, prosumers, and organizations, leaving a meaningful gap in the market.

**This gap isn’t an accident; it’s structural.** Work environments presented the lowest-friction surface for deploying AI. Workflows are explicit, outcomes are measurable, and context is relatively stable. AI tooling evolved for desktop environments, where native integrations and permissive access to local context are the norm. What was technically feasible shaped what product teams chose to prioritize.

Because this architecture works in professional settings, where context is structured, permissioned, and relatively standardized, the ecosystem converged around a common pattern: models paired with tool calling and desktop-native context access, formalized through protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Intelligence lives in the model, action flows through tools, and context is pulled from systems the OS already knows how to expose. On macOS, MCP servers expose files, notes, messages, calendars, and other system resources, giving AI deep visibility into a user’s digital workspace.

Inspiration often comes from passive consumption; an IG or TikTok video. Intent is fluid and situational. A user shopping for work clothes is expressing a different identity, set of constraints, and priorities than the same user shopping for workout gear later that day. People do not have a single, consistent “persona”; they operate across multiple modes depending on vibe, time, role, and context.

Compounding this, personal workflows are highly non-standardized. Everyone has a bespoke system, often loosely held together with Apple Notes, screenshots, reminders, saved links, and half-finished to-do lists. There is no canonical schema for "life". The workflows themselves are open-ended and heterogeneous in nature, spanning areas such as:
- Personal administration (bills, forms, renewals)
- Health and wellness management
- Household and maintenance
- Scheduling and coordination
- Travel and logistics
- Finances and subscriptions
- Digital organization (email, files, photos)

Each of these domains differs in cadence, emotional weight, and structure, and they frequently intersect in unpredictable ways. Compared to professional workflows, this is a problem of an entirely different magnitude. Building a truly personal AI requires a system that can reason across fragmented signals, shifting identities, and non-deterministic goals, while maintaining long-term context and trust.

This creates the fundamental challenge facing personal AI: how do you build a system that understands the full context of a user’s life, when that context is deeply personal, deeply fragmented, and constantly evolving?

It's a magnitude larger and more complex problem.
